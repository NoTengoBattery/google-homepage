Google Home Page
---

This reposotory holds my [@notengobattery] version of Google's Home Page, which
a project suggested by the Odin Project. This page does nothing, and it's not
responsive in the sense that it does not change the view on smaller screens
(like the Google's real page would do).

It probably just scales itself dow, and it's designed to be observed in a
desktop screen or maybe it can work in the landscape view of some mobile
devices and tablets.
